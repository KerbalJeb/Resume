\resumeSection{C++ and OpenGL Falling Sand Game}{}
{Created a basic 'falling sand' game that simulates and renders the interaction between different particles. See \url{https://youtu.be/FlTeCNOKR9w} for a demo}{
    \item Written in C++20 and built using CMake and unit tested using the Catch2 framework
}

\resumeSection{Computer Vision Position Estimator}{}
{Worked with a team of students to develop a prototype sensor system to allow for autonomous charging for electric marine vessels}{
    \item Developed a Python application using OpenCV to demonstrate marker position estimation
    \item Tested system under different lighting and weather conditions
    \item Computed the position and rotation of markers in real time with millimeter accuracy
}

% \resumeSection{USB Firmware Driver}{}
% {Wrote a custom device-side USB 'stack' for the USB peripheral on an STM32 MCU to make it behave as a serial port (CDC Class) without using vendor provided libraries}{
%     \item Wrote a driver to implement a USB virtual com port
%     \item Written in C for an STM32F0 MCU on a custom PCB
%     \item Used a logic analyzer to debug the driver
% }

\resumeSection{Conveyor Belt Sorter}{}
{Worked with a partner to develop firmware for a conveyor belt and sorter system that was able to sort and classify 48 items based on reflectivity in 22 seconds (class project)}
{
    \item Implemented UART command line interface that proved very useful during testing and development
    \item Developed stepper motor control and trapezoidal path planning to optimize travel times
    \item Implemented a logistic regression based classifier to identify cylinders of four different material based on reflectivity
    \item Wrote custom CMake scripts to build and upload the firmware to the AVR target
