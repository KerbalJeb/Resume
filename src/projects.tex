\resumeSection{C++ and OpenGL Falling Sand Game}{}
{Created a basic 'falling sand' game that simulates and renders the interaction between different particles. See \url{https://youtu.be/FlTeCNOKR9w} for a demo}{
    \item Written in C++20 and built using CMake
    \item Unit tested using the Catch2 framework
}

\resumeSection{Computer Vision Position Estimator}{}
{Worked with a team of students to develop a prototype sensor system to allow for autonomous charging for electric marine vessels}{
    \item Developed a Python application using OpenCV to demonstrate marker position estimation
    \item Tested system under different lighting and weather conditions
    \item Computed the position and rotation of markers in real time with millimeter accuracy
}

\resumeSection{USB Firmware Driver}{}
{Wrote a custom device-side USB 'stack' for the USB peripheral on an STM32 MCU to make it behave as a serial port (CDC Class)}{
    \item Wrote a driver to implement a USB virtual com port
    \item Written in C for an STM32F0 MCU on a custom PCB
    \item Used a logic analyzer to debug the driver
